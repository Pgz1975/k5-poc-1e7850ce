## Success Criteria

✅ Dashboard displays ALL required metrics from Compliance_Summary.md Section F
✅ Skills broken down into 4 separate trackable areas
✅ Assessment results visible with 3 diagnostic periods
✅ Export works in Excel and PDF formats
✅ Filters work by skill, language, date range, device
✅ Teacher resources section populated with mock activities
✅ Comparative analytics show class vs. school/region/island
✅ Cultural localization features visible (PEI, Puerto Rican content)
✅ All text is bilingual (Spanish/English)
✅ UI remains responsive and user-friendly

---

## Technical Notes

- All mock data will be stored in `/src/data/` directory
- Use existing design system (semantic colors, shadcn components)
- Maintain responsive design (mobile-first)
- Keep bilingual support with `useLanguage()` context
- Charts use Recharts library (already installed)
- Export functionality will use mock downloads initially (real implementation requires backend)
- All new components follow existing patterns (Card, Table, Badge, etc.)

---

## Estimated Implementation Time

- **Phase 1**: 4 hours
- **Phase 2**: 3 hours
- **Phase 3**: 3 hours
- **Phase 4**: 4 hours
- **Phase 5**: 3 hours
- **Phase 6**: 2 hours
- **Phase 7**: 2 hours
- **Phase 8**: 3 hours

**Total: ~24 hours of development**

Split into 3 implementation sessions:
1. **Session 1 (8 hours)**: Phases 1-3 (metrics, skills, assessments)
2. **Session 2 (8 hours)**: Phases 4-5 (filters, exports, resources)
3. **Session 3 (8 hours)**: Phases 6-8 (comparisons, localization, student profiles)

This is a comprehensive plan to bring the Teacher Dashboard into full compliance with all the requirements from the documentation. The plan prioritizes the most critical features for the demo (usage metrics, skills tracking, assessment results, and export functionality) while also addressing all the differentiating factors mentioned in the requirements.

The implementation is broken down into manageable phases with clear deliverables, mock data structures, and new component designs. All features maintain the existing V2 design aesthetic while adding substantial functionality.
