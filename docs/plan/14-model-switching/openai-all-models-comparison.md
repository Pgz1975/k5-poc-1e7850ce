## Cost Calculation for 100,000 Students

### Usage Pattern:
- 100,000 students
- 300,000 sessions/week = 1.3M sessions/month
- 5 minutes audio input per session = 6.5M minutes/month
- 2 minutes audio output per session = 2.6M minutes/month
- Token rate: ~3,000 tokens per minute of audio

### Token Consumption:
- **Audio Input:** 6.5M minutes × 3,000 = 19.5B tokens/month
- **Audio Output:** 2.6M minutes × 3,000 = 7.8B tokens/month

## Realistic Caching Assumptions

The calculations above assume 98% cache hit rate, which is VERY aggressive. More realistic scenarios:

### Scenario A: 80% Cache Hit Rate (Realistic)

**gpt-4o-mini-realtime (Best Value):**
- Input cached: 15,600M × $0.30 = $4,680
- Input uncached: 3,900M × $10 = $39,000
- Output: 7,800M × $20 = $156,000
- **TOTAL: $199,680/month ($2.4M/year) = $23.97/student/year**

**gpt-realtime GA:**
- Input cached: 15,600M × $0.40 = $6,240
- Input uncached: 3,900M × $32 = $124,800
- Output: 7,800M × $64 = $499,200
- **TOTAL: $630,240/month ($7.6M/year) = $75.62/student/year**

### Scenario B: 50% Cache Hit Rate (Conservative)

**gpt-4o-mini-realtime:**
- Input cached: 9,750M × $0.30 = $2,925
- Input uncached: 9,750M × $10 = $97,500
- Output: 7,800M × $20 = $156,000
- **TOTAL: $256,425/month ($3.1M/year) = $30.77/student/year**

**gpt-realtime GA:**
- Input cached: 9,750M × $0.40 = $3,900
- Input uncached: 9,750M × $32 = $312,000
- Output: 7,800M × $64 = $499,200
- **TOTAL: $815,100/month ($9.8M/year) = $97.81/student/year**

| **K-5 Fit** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Perfect) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Perfect) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Overkill) |

---

## Final Recommendation

### Primary Recommendation: Web Speech API (Current)
**Stay with the current implementation.**
- Zero cost vs $2M - $42M annually
- 95%+ accuracy already excellent for K-5
- Best privacy (client-side)
- Proven with 100,000 students

### Alternative IF Budget Increases to $2M+/year:
**Consider gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview-2024-12-17**
- 10x cheaper than full models
- Still excellent quality for K-5 reading
- Advanced features (emotion detection, function calling)
- Requires 12x budget increase ($161K → $2M)

### NOT Recommended:
**Full gpt-realtime or gpt-4o-realtime models**
- Cost $6M - $42M/year (38x - 260x current budget)
- Overkill for K-5 reading exercises
- Students don't need premium conversational AI
- ROI doesn't justify cost for educational use case

---

## Implementation Path (If Choosing OpenAI)

### Phase 1: Pilot (5% of sessions)
- Use gpt-4o-mini-realtime
- 65,000 sessions/month
- Cost: ~$100K/year
- Evaluate quality improvements vs Web Speech

### Phase 2: Expand (20% of sessions)
- If pilot successful
- 260,000 sessions/month
- Cost: ~$400K/year
- A/B test with Web Speech

### Phase 3: Scale (100% of sessions)
- Only if demonstrable ROI
- 1.3M sessions/month
- Cost: $2M - $2.4M/year
- Requires budget approval for 12x increase

---

## Conclusion

**Current recommendation remains: Web Speech API**

The cost difference is too significant to justify switching to OpenAI Realtime API:
- **Cheapest OpenAI option:** $2M/year (12x current total budget)
- **Most expensive:** $42M/year (260x current total budget)
- **Current solution:** Free, 95%+ accurate, proven at scale

Unless budget increases dramatically ($2M+/year) AND there are specific requirements for advanced conversational AI features (emotion detection, complex function calling, image analysis), Web Speech API provides the best value for K-5 reading education.

**Savings by staying with Web Speech API:** $2,000,000 - $42,000,000 per year
