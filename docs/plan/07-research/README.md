### Evidence-Based Design Decisions

1. **20-30 Adaptive Questions vs 40+ Traditional**
   - Based on IRT research showing 50% reduction possible
   - Maintains reliability (α > 0.90)
   - Reduces test fatigue

2. **Bilingual Simultaneous Support**
   - Translanguaging approach (García & Wei, 2014)
   - Code-switching as resource not deficit
   - Both languages always available

3. **Coquí Mascot Integration**
   - Culturally responsive (Gay, 2010)
   - Local cultural symbol
   - Increases engagement and relevance

4. **Voice Recognition for Reading**
   - Oral reading fluency predictor (Rasinski, 2017)
   - Real-time feedback importance (Neri et al., 2008)
   - Pronunciation accuracy critical for ELLs

5. **Gamification Elements**
   - Meta-analysis shows 0.45 effect size
   - Particularly effective for K-5 age group
   - Points, badges, levels proven effective

## Research Validation

### Methodology
- Systematic literature review
- Meta-analysis of effect sizes
- Best practices synthesis
- Puerto Rico context analysis

### Quality Criteria
- Peer-reviewed sources only
