### ✅ 5. Auto-Initiation Flow
**Requirement:** "As soon as i launch the demo, there is a text sent to the api asking it to introduce itself and the platform, and ask user a question, then wait for the answer and then answer afterwards"

**Plan Validation:**
- ✅ Automatic greeting on connection establishment
- ✅ Platform introduction in selected language
- ✅ Question to engage student interaction
- ✅ Turn-based conversation management
- ✅ Proper wait for student response

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Auto-sent on connection
Spanish: "¡Hola! Soy tu guía de aprendizaje. Estoy aquí para ayudarte a navegar nuestra plataforma y hacer que aprender sea divertido. ¿Cómo te sientes sobre empezar las actividades de hoy?"

English: "Hello! I'm your learning guide. I'm here to help you navigate our platform and make learning fun! How are you feeling about starting today's activities?"
```

### ✅ 6. Bilingual Platform Integration
**Requirement:** "Platform is bilingual and has a language switch. The realtime API will called in spanish with puerto rican accent and vocabulary, and the other in english with american accent. So there are in fact 2 demos"

**Plan Validation:**
- ✅ Integration with existing `LanguageContext`
- ✅ Spanish (Puerto Rican): echo voice, local vocabulary
- ✅ English (American): ash voice, American expressions
- ✅ Seamless language switching during session
- ✅ Cultural appropriateness for both contexts
- ✅ Single demo page that adapts to language context

**Implementation:**
- Real-time language switching with reconnection
- Cultural instruction sets for each language
- Bilingual UI with existing translation system
- Language-specific error handling

### ✅ 7. No Existing Code Alteration
**Requirement:** "DO NOT IN ANY WAY ALTER EXISTING CODE"

**Plan Validation:**
- ✅ All new files in dedicated locations
- ✅ No modification to existing components
- ✅ Integration through existing contexts only
- ✅ Additive routing changes only
- ✅ Clear separation from existing realtime implementations

**New Files Only:**
```
src/pages/demo/RealtimeStudentGuideDemo.tsx
src/hooks/useStudentGuideRealtime.ts
src/lib/realtime/StudentGuideRealtimeClient.ts
src/lib/realtime/languageConfigs.ts
src/components/demo/RealtimeTranscript.tsx
src/components/demo/ConnectionStatus.tsx
supabase/functions/realtime-student-guide-token/index.ts
```

### ✅ 8. WebRTC Documentation Compliance
**Requirement:** "Follow OpenAI's realtime WebRTC flow with standard API key minting performed server-side"

**Plan Validation:**
- ✅ Ephemeral token approach as documented
- ✅ Server-side standard API key usage
- ✅ Proper SDP exchange flow
- ✅ Data channel event handling
- ✅ Audio stream configuration per documentation

**Implementation:**
- Exact API endpoints as documented
- Proper WebRTC peer connection setup
- Standard event handling patterns
- Security best practices followed

### ✅ 9. Detailed Plan Creation
**Requirement:** "Create the plan in docs/plan/25-new-realtime-demo"

**Plan Validation:**
- ✅ Comprehensive plan documentation
- ✅ Technical specifications
- ✅ Language configurations
- ✅ API specifications
- ✅ Testing strategy
- ✅ Deployment checklist

**Deliverables:**
