// Identify students needing intervention
function identifyAtRiskStudents(results: AssessmentResult[]): string[] {
  const atRisk = [];
  for (const student of groupByStudent(results)) {
    const recentScores = student.scores.slice(-3); // Last 3 assessments
    const avgScore = mean(recentScores);
    if (avgScore < 60 || recentScores.every(s => s < 70)) {
      atRisk.push(student.id);
    }
  }
  return atRisk;

https://doi.org/10.3102/003465430298487

**Summary:** Meta-analysis of 196 studies on feedback, identifying effective feedback characteristics.

**Effective Feedback (K5 provides):**
1. **Timely:** Immediate after assessment submission ✓
2. **Specific:** Explanation for each question ✓
3. **Actionable:** Recommendations for improvement ✓
4. **Goal-referenced:** Compared to grade-level benchmarks ✓

**Feedback Types:**
- **Task:** "You correctly identified the main character."
- **Process:** "Try re-reading to find key details."
- **Self-regulation:** "You're improving your reading fluency!"
- **Self:** Avoid ("You're smart") – emphasize effort, not ability

https://doi.org/10.3102/0034654307313795

**Summary:** Review of formative feedback research, distinguishing effective vs. ineffective feedback.

**K5 Formative Feedback:**
- After each module (formative assessment)
- After each question (immediate correctness feedback)
- Weekly progress summary (parent email)
- Bi-weekly teacher reports (class-level trends)

### Learning Analytics

**Siemens, G., & Long, P. (2011).** Penetrating the fog: Analytics in learning and education. *EDUCAUSE Review*, 46(5), 30-40.

**Summary:** Foundational article on learning analytics, defining the field and outlining key applications.

**K5 Analytics Layers:**

1. **Descriptive:** What happened?
   - Assessment scores, completion rates, time spent

2. **Diagnostic:** Why did it happen?
   - Comprehension breakdown (literal vs. inferential)
   - Error analysis (question types missed)

3. **Predictive:** What will happen?
   - At-risk student identification
   - Projected end-of-year proficiency

4. **Prescriptive:** What should be done?
   - Personalized course recommendations
   - Intervention strategies

https://doi.org/10.1504/IJTEL.2012.051816

**Summary:** Overview of learning analytics field, including ethical considerations and institutional challenges.

**K5 Ethical Analytics:**
- Transparency: Parents see what data is collected
- Consent: Opt-in for analytics beyond basic progress tracking
- Privacy: Aggregate data for research (no individual identification)
- Bias audits: Regular checks for fairness across demographics
