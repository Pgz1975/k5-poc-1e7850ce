## 🎯 Quick Start Guide

### For Developers:

1. **Read documents in this order:**
   ```
   1. MAIN-PLAN.md (understand the vision)
   2. UI-MOCKUPS.md (see what we're building)
   3. COMPONENT-STRUCTURE.md (understand the code)
   4. DATABASE-SCHEMA.md (set up database)
   5. VOICE-INTEGRATION.md (understand voice system)
   6. IMPLEMENTATION-STEPS.md (start building)
   ```

2. **Start implementation:**
   ```bash
   # Phase 1: Database
   - Create migration file
   - Add schema from DATABASE-SCHEMA.md
   - Run migration
   - Create storage bucket

   # Phase 2: UI Components
   - Create component files
   - Copy code from COMPONENT-STRUCTURE.md
   - Test each component

   # Continue through phases...
   ```

3. **Reference while building:**
   - UI-MOCKUPS.md for visual design
   - COMPONENT-STRUCTURE.md for code patterns
   - VOICE-INTEGRATION.md for voice features

## 🔑 Key Principles

### 1. SIMPLICITY
- No over-engineering
- Straightforward React components
- Direct database operations
- Minimal abstractions

### 2. REUSE
- Copy styles from `/reading-exercise`
- Use existing `useRealtimeVoice` hook
- Use existing UI component library
- Leverage existing database patterns

### 3. SPEED
- 40 hours total implementation
- 5 working days
- Working system at each phase
- Fast iteration over perfection

### 4. USER-FOCUSED
- Teacher can create in < 5 minutes
- Kid-friendly student view
- Voice guidance is key
- Mobile-first (tablets)

- Assessment marketplace
- AI-assisted question generation
- Gamification elements
- Certificate generation
- Parent notifications
