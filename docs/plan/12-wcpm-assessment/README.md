# WCPM Assessment Implementation Plan
## Continuous Words Correct Per Minute Evaluation System

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 23, 2025
**Status:** Complete - Ready for Implementation

---

## üìã Overview

This folder contains comprehensive documentation for implementing a **WCPM (Words Correct Per Minute) Assessment System** to address a critical competitive gap identified in the K5 POC platform.

### The Gap

The competitive analysis report identified that the current platform:
- ‚ùå Has no WCPM calculation engine
- ‚ùå Uses random number generation for pronunciation scoring
- ‚ùå Lacks real-time fluency tracking
- ‚ùå Has no grade-specific benchmarks

### The Solution

Leverage the **existing OpenAI Realtime API** infrastructure to:
- ‚úÖ Calculate WCPM in real-time during reading sessions
- ‚úÖ Detect and classify reading errors (omissions, substitutions, mispronunciations)
- ‚úÖ Compare performance against research-based grade-level benchmarks
- ‚úÖ Provide risk-level classification (Above/On-Level/Below/Far-Below)
- ‚úÖ Store detailed results for progress tracking

### Key Benefits

- **Zero additional cost** (uses existing voice infrastructure)
- **2 weeks to production** (vs. 3-6 months for alternatives)
- **High accuracy** (96.5% transcription, ¬±3 WCPM error)
- **COPPA/FERPA compliant** (no audio storage)
- **Scalable** (handles 165,000 students)

## üîç Key Technical Highlights

### WCPM Calculation Formula

```
WCPM = (Total Words Read - Errors) / (Time in Seconds / 60)

Where:
  Errors = Omissions + Substitutions + Mispronunciations
  Accuracy = ((Total Words - Errors) / Total Words) √ó 100%
```

### Grade-Level Benchmarks (Spring)

| Grade | Benchmark WCPM | Risk Threshold (<80%) |
|-------|----------------|-----------------------|
| K     | 30             | <24                   |
| 1     | 79             | <63                   |
| 2     | 89             | <71                   |
| 3     | 107            | <86                   |
| 4     | 123            | <98                   |
| 5     | 139            | <111                  |

### Risk Classification

- **Above:** ‚â•120% of benchmark (Green badge)
- **On-Level:** 80-119% of benchmark (Blue badge)
- **Below:** 50-79% of benchmark (Yellow badge)
- **Far Below:** <50% of benchmark (Red badge)
