- **4-5 (ages 9-11)**: Standard text (1.125rem), more advanced features

### 2. Cultural Relevance
- Coquí (Puerto Rican tree frog) as friendly mascot
- Puerto Rico-themed badges and rewards
- Local landmarks (El Yunque, beaches, etc.)
- Bilingual throughout (Spanish primary, English secondary)

### 3. Accessibility First
- WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Touch targets ≥ 44px (≥ 64px for K-1)
- Color contrast ratios ≥ 4.5:1
- Reduced motion support

### 4. Mobile-First
- Responsive layouts (320px to 2560px)
- Touch-optimized interactions
- Offline PWA support
- Fast load times (<3s)

### 5. Privacy & Safety
- COPPA compliant
