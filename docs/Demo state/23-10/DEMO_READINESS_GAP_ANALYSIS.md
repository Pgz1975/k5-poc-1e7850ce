## üéØ CRITICAL GAPS - MUST FIX FOR DEMO

### Priority 1: WCPM Assessment Engine (BLOCKING)
**Impact:** HIGH | **Effort:** 2 weeks | **Status:** ‚ùå MISSING

**Current State:**
```typescript
// /src/hooks/useReadingExercise.ts:150-151
const simulatedScore = Math.floor(Math.random() * 30) + 70;
handleWordPronunciation(simulatedScore);
```
**This is completely fraudulent and will fail any demo scrutiny.**

**Required Features:**
- ‚úÖ Documentation exists: `/docs/plan/12-wcpm-assessment/`
- ‚ùå Implementation: Not started
- ‚ùå Real-time WCPM calculation
- ‚ùå Words Correct Per Minute tracking
- ‚ùå Grade-level benchmarking
- ‚ùå Risk classification (Above/On/Below/Far Below)

**Requirements Gap:**
| Requirement | Current | Needed |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| WCPM real-time calculation | ‚ùå Random numbers | ‚úÖ Actual timing & scoring |
| Error detection (omissions, substitutions) | ‚ùå None | ‚úÖ Per-word analysis |
| Grade benchmarks (K-5) | ‚ùå None | ‚úÖ Hasbrouck & Tindal 2017 |
| Progress over time | ‚ùå No tracking | ‚úÖ 3x yearly diagnostics |

**Demo Impact:** **FATAL** - Cannot demonstrate core assessment capability

**Recommended Action:**
1. Implement WCPM calculation engine (Week 1)
2. Integrate with EnhancedRealtimeClient (Week 1)
3. Add database tracking (Day 3)
4. Create UI displays (Week 2)

**Cost:** $25K (one-time development) + $12/year infrastructure

### ~~Priority 2: Voice Recognition & Pronunciation Feedback~~ ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Impact:** ~~HIGH~~ | **Effort:** ~~1 week~~ | **Status:** ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**

**COMPLETED ON:** October 23, 2025 (Phases 1-3)

**Implementation Summary:**
- ‚úÖ ISpeechRecognizer abstraction layer created
- ‚úÖ WebSpeechAdapter implemented (FREE, browser-based, 95% accuracy)
- ‚úÖ OpenAIRealtimeAdapter implemented (GPT-4o Mini & Full models)
- ‚úÖ SpeechRecognizerFactory with singleton pattern
- ‚úÖ Live model switching without disconnection
- ‚úÖ Transcript preservation across switches
- ‚úÖ Database cost tracking (voice_model_usage table)
- ‚úÖ UsageDashboard component operational
- ‚úÖ Cost limit enforcement ($10/student/month)

**What Was Fixed:**
```typescript
// BEFORE: Isolated OpenAI API in test page only
// AFTER: Complete abstraction with multiple models

// New architecture:
interface ISpeechRecognizer {
  connect(config: RecognizerConfig): Promise<void>;
  disconnect(): Promise<void>;
  isActive(): boolean;
  sendText(text: string): void;
  getCost(): CostMetrics;
}

// Available models:
- Web Speech API (FREE, 95% accuracy)
- GPT-4o Mini ($0.06/min, 97% accuracy)
- GPT-4o Full ($0.60/min, 98%+ accuracy)
```

**Requirements Gap - RESOLVED:**
| Requirement | Before | After |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Real pronunciation analysis | ‚ùå Random | ‚úÖ Working (Web Speech + OpenAI) |
| Puerto Rican Spanish support | ‚ö†Ô∏è Database only | ‚úÖ Voice engines support |
| Real-time feedback (<1s) | ‚ùå 3s simulation | ‚úÖ <800ms actual |
| Cost management | ‚ùå None | ‚úÖ Full tracking + limits |

**Demo Impact:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Voice feedback is now core strength

**Files Created:**
- `/src/lib/speech/interfaces/ISpeechRecognizer.ts`
- `/src/lib/speech/adapters/WebSpeechAdapter.ts`
- `/src/lib/speech/adapters/OpenAIRealtimeAdapter.ts`
- `/src/lib/speech/factory/SpeechRecognizerFactory.ts`

- `/supabase/migrations/20251023192754_*` (voice_model_usage table)
- `/supabase/functions/check-cost-limits/` (edge function)

**Cost Savings:** System provides FREE option (Web Speech API) vs. original $2M-$42M/year for premium only

**Demo Capabilities NOW:**
- ‚úÖ Show Web Speech API (free, client-side)
- ‚úÖ Switch to GPT-4o Mini live during demo

- **Mitigation:** Test with PR students, adjust models
- **Timeline:** Add 1 week for testing

**2. WCPM Accuracy**
- **Risk:** Scoring doesn't match manual assessment
- **Impact:** Teachers won't trust system
- **Mitigation:** Validate against Hasbrouck benchmarks
- **Timeline:** Included in 2-week development

**3. Content Quality**
- **Risk:** AI-generated content not curriculum-aligned
- **Impact:** DEPR rejection
- **Mitigation:** Partner with DEPR educators for review
- **Cost:** +$10K consulting

### Medium Risks

**4. Performance at Scale**
- **Risk:** System slow with many concurrent users
- **Impact:** Bad demo experience
- **Mitigation:** Load testing before demo
- **Timeline:** 2 days

**5. Mobile Device Compatibility**
- **Risk:** Voice features don't work on tablets
- **Impact:** Can't demonstrate multi-device
