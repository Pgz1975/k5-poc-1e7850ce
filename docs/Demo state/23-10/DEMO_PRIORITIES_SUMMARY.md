## üö® DEAL-BREAKER ISSUES (UPDATED)

### ~~Issue #2: Voice AI Not Connected~~ ‚úÖ FIXED
**Status:** **RESOLVED** (Oct 23, 2025)

**The Solution:**
- ‚úÖ ISpeechRecognizer abstraction created
- ‚úÖ Web Speech API integrated (free, 95% accuracy)
- ‚úÖ OpenAI Realtime API available as premium option
- ‚úÖ Live model switching implemented
- ‚úÖ Cost tracking operational

**Files:**
- `/src/lib/speech/` - Complete speech system
- `/src/pages/VoiceTest.tsx` - Fully integrated
- Database tables created and working

---

### Issue #1: Fraudulent Scoring (STILL BLOCKING)
**File:** `/src/hooks/useReadingExercise.ts:150-151`

```typescript
// THIS WILL STILL KILL THE DEMO:
const simulatedScore = Math.floor(Math.random() * 30) + 70;
handleWordPronunciation(simulatedScore);
```

**Fix:** Implement WCPM engine (Week 1-2, $25K)
**Impact:** Without this fix, **demo will fail scrutiny**
**Priority:** **#1 BLOCKING**

---

### Issue #3: Content Library (IMPROVED BUT STILL BLOCKING)
**Database:** `manual_assessments` table in Supabase

**The Numbers:**
- ‚úÖ **Have: 66 assessments** (up from 5!)
  - Grade K: 6 assessments
  - Grade 1: 60 assessments
  - Languages: 64 Spanish, 2 English
  - All with questions and images
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need for pilot: 150-180 exercises (20 per grade)
- ‚ùå Need for full: 900+ lessons

**Current Gap:** 66/150 = 44% of pilot content ‚úÖ

**Fix:** Content development (Weeks 2-3, $10-15K - REDUCED)
**Impact:** Can demonstrate variety for K-1, need more grades
**Priority:** **#2 MEDIUM** (improved from HIGH)

---

## üìã QUICK DECISION CHECKLIST (UPDATED)

### Can we do the demo NOW?
‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL** - Voice system works, but WCPM still fake

### What's the minimum to make it work?
‚úÖ **5 weeks + $53K** (Option B - Recommended)
**REDUCED from 6 weeks + $68K**

### What changed since last analysis?
‚úÖ **Voice system complete** - Saves $15K and 1 week
‚úÖ **Cost tracking working** - Admin demo ready
‚úÖ **Model switching** - Can show FREE vs PREMIUM comparison
‚ö†Ô∏è **WCPM still fake** - Still the #1 blocker

### What if we can't wait 5 weeks?
‚ö†Ô∏è **3 weeks + $33K** (Option A - Minimum viable)
- Demo will be limited but functional
- Voice system already working
- Must be honest about WCPM "in progress"

---
