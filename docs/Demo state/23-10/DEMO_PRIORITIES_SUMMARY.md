## üé¨ DEMO SCENARIO READINESS

| Scenario | Now | After Fix | What's Needed |
|----------|-----|-----------|---------------|
| Student reads aloud | ‚ö†Ô∏è 40% | ‚úÖ 90% | WCPM + Voice (Weeks 1-2) |

## üö® DEAL-BREAKER ISSUES

### Issue #1: Fraudulent Scoring
**File:** `/src/hooks/useReadingExercise.ts:150-151`

```typescript
// THIS WILL KILL THE DEMO:
const simulatedScore = Math.floor(Math.random() * 30) + 70;
handleWordPronunciation(simulatedScore);
```

**Fix:** Implement WCPM engine (Week 1-2, $25K)
**Impact:** Without this fix, **demo will fail scrutiny**

---

### Issue #2: Voice AI Not Connected
**File:** `/src/pages/VoiceTest.tsx` (isolated)

**The Problem:**
- ‚úÖ Advanced OpenAI Realtime API exists
- ‚ùå Only used in test page
- ‚ùå Production uses basic Web Speech API

**Fix:** Integration work (Week 2, $8K)
**Impact:** Without this, no real pronunciation feedback

---

### Issue #3: Content Desert
**File:** `/src/data/readingExercises.ts`

**The Numbers:**
- Have: 5 exercises
- Need for pilot: 150 exercises
- Need for full: 900+ lessons

**Fix:** Content development (Weeks 2-3, $15-30K)
**Impact:** Can't demonstrate variety or progression

---

## üìã QUICK DECISION CHECKLIST

### Can we do the demo NOW?
‚ùå **NO** - Critical features are simulated/missing

### What's the minimum to make it work?
‚úÖ **6 weeks + $68K** (Option B - Recommended)

### What if we can't wait 6 weeks?
‚ö†Ô∏è **4 weeks + $38K** (Option A - Minimum viable)
- Demo will be limited
- Must be honest about "in progress" features

### What if budget is tight?
‚ö†Ô∏è **Prioritize:**
1. WCPM engine ($25K) - **Non-negotiable**
2. Voice integration ($8K) - **Critical**
3. Delay content development - Use 5-10 exercises

---

## üéØ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### This Week
1. ‚úÖ **Approve budget:** Choose Option A, B, or C
2. ‚úÖ **Assign team:**
   - Senior Developer (WCPM lead)
   - Voice/AI Engineer
   - Content Specialist
3. ‚úÖ **Set deadline:** Target demo date

### Week 1 Kickoff
**Day 1:**

## üí° KEY INSIGHTS

### What We Learned

1. **Infrastructure is excellent** (9/10)
   - Database schema better than competitors
   - UI/UX professional and accessible
   - Multi-tenant architecture solid

2. **Core features are simulated** (2/10)
   - WCPM: Random numbers
   - Voice: Fake scoring
   - Content: 99.7% empty

3. **We have the tech but don't use it**
   - OpenAI Realtime API exists
   - Isolated in test page
   - Not connected to production

### The Paradox

> "We built a Formula 1 car but installed a bicycle engine"

**Translation:** Advanced infrastructure with simulated features
