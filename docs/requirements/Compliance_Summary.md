# Compliance Summary – Functional Demo ("Sample")

## Overview

Demo must align with the DEPR's requirements for a functional sample by demonstrating a live, bilingual AI-based reading platform with active voice recognition, differentiated user roles (students, teachers, administrators, and parents), and operational dashboards. The demo will provide temporary access to an active system for evaluation, fulfilling the requirement for a functional—not prototype—demonstration. It will show representative content for Grades K–5 in both English and Spanish, illustrate adaptive AI capabilities, and simulate core dashboard metrics per user type.
