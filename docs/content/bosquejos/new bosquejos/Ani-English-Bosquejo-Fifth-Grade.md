**1 – Below Grade Level: “The Drone That Saved the Science Fair”**  
**Revised Format \- Below Grade Le…**  
**Domains Covered**  
Phonemic Awareness · Phonics · Vocabulary · Fluency · Comprehension · Writing

**Objective**  
Students decode STEM-related terms, apply vocabulary strategies, and demonstrate comprehension of cause-and-effect through a story about innovation and perseverance.

**Standards** 5.L.1a · 5.L.4a · 5.R.3A · 5.R.4 · 5.R.1–5.R.6 · 5.W.1 · 5.W.3

**Phase 1 – Listening Warm-Up**

* Rhymes and beginning-sound recognition using *drone*, *calibrate*, *stabilize*   
* Exercises reinforce long vowels (/ō/), blends (/st/), and soft c patterns.  
  *AI Feedback:* “Excellent\! You identified the science sounds correctly.”

**Phase 2 – Phonics & Word Work**  
Students complete drag-and-drop and fill-in tasks on affixes and syllable counts:

* re- \= “again”   
* stabilize \= 3 syllables   
* science → soft c   
  AI Feedback: “You built the word pattern scientists use\!”

**Phase 3 – Vocabulary in Context**  
Words: drone, calibrate, prototype, stabilize, teamwork, troubleshoot.  
Activities: synonym/antonym match, root identification, and figurative-language recognition (simile vs metaphor).  
*AI Feedback:* “Great job using context to find word meaning\!”

**Phase 4 – Fluency & Expression**  
Students practice rhythm and punctuation pauses:

* “We need to recharge it, Roberto\!” → comma \= short pause   
* “It’s flying\!” → excited tone   
  AI Feedback: “Your reading sounds confident and clear\!”

**Phase 5 – Reading Comprehension**  
Literal → Where did they present? → *In the school gym*   
Inferential → Why go to the tech station? → *Recharge battery*   
Analytical → What did they learn? → *Collaboration leads to success* 

**Phase 6 – Writing & Reflection**  
Students complete sentences, short summaries, and grammar checks:

* “María and Roberto worked together to solve the problem”  
* Verb-tense practice (calibrated \= past)  
* Open prompt: “What would you invent for a future science fair?”

**Phase 7 – Closing & Mini-Assessment**  
Students answer main-idea, sequence, and vocabulary questions:

* Main idea → Science and teamwork solved the problem   
* Vocabulary → troubleshoot \= find and fix a problem   
  Reflection: “How did María and Roberto’s teamwork help them succeed?”

**Lesson 2 – On Grade Level: “Operation Mangrove Rescue”**  
**Revised Format \- On Grade Level…**

**Domains Covered**  
Phonics · Vocabulary · Fluency · Comprehension · Writing · Civic Engagement

**Objective**  
Students analyze how teamwork and environmental action protect ecosystems, applying advanced vocabulary and inferential comprehension to real-world science.

**Standards** 5.L.1a · 5.L.4a–b · 5.R.3A · 5.R.4 · 5.R.1–5.R.6 · 5.W.1 · 5.W.3

**Phase 1 – Listening Warm-Up**

* Rhymes (shore / more) and sound identification (mangrove / mountain)  
* Short/long vowel review (roots → long vowel)  
  AI Feedback: “You’re hearing the rhythm of science words\!”

**Phase 2 – Phonics & Word Work**  
Focus on morphology:

* Prefix *re-* \= again   
* Suffix *\-ion* \= process   
* Compound construction (*re \+ store \+ ation*)  
  *AI Feedback:* “You built the word restoration like a scientist\!”

**Phase 3 – Vocabulary in Context**

* Words: mangrove, erosion, habitat, balance, biodiversity.   
* Students match meanings, analyze figurative language (“The mangroves are the coast’s shield” \= metaphor).  
  AI Feedback: “You connected language and nature perfectly.”

**Phase 4 – Fluency & Expression**

* Model sentences: “The mangroves made it through the storm\!” Practice intonation and beat patterns for oral presentation.  
  *AI Feedback:* “Great expression — you sound like an environmental leader\!”

**Phase 5 – Reading Comprehension**  
Literal → Main concern \= mangrove erosion   
Inferential → Roots protected soil   
Analytical → Lesson \= Protecting nature requires knowledge and care 

**Phase 6 – Writing & Reflection**  
Students write to summarize and apply concepts:   
    “Students worked with their community to restore a mangrove habitat.”

* “Science and language can work together to solve real problems.”  
  *AI Feedback:* “Your words show leadership and hope for our planet.”
