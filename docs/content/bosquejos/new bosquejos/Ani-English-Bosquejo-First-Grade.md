**Blueprint – AI Adaptive Interactive Reading Module (Grade 1, Below Level)**

**Purpose of the Module**

To develop early literacy skills — phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary, fluency, and comprehension — through interactive, bilingual lessons guided by AI.  
Each lesson integrates reading, speaking, listening, and socio-emotional learning using age-appropriate texts and immediate feedback.

**Pedagogical Focus**  
Foundational Literacy: sound-symbol correspondence, sight-word fluency.  
Socio-Emotional Connection: family, culture, pride in Puerto Rico.  
Adaptive Learning: differentiated pacing and feedback.  
Multimodal Engagement: visual, auditory, and kinesthetic interaction.

**General Structure**

**General Structure – AI Reading Module (First Grade, Below Level)**

| Section | Description | Aligned Standards (PRDE – Grade 1\) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Story narration** | The AI reads the story aloud with natural pauses and visual highlighting. Students follow along, building rhythm, attention, and word recognition. | 1.R.1 – Demonstrate understanding of spoken words and print. 1.R.2 – Identify key details and main idea in a text. |
| **Phonemic & phonics practice** | Students listen, repeat, isolate, and blend sounds to form CVC and sight words. The AI models correct pronunciation and sound blending. | 1.R.3 – Know and apply grade-level phonics and decoding skills. 1.R.4 – Read with sufficient accuracy and fluency. |
| **Vocabulary & comprehension** | New words are introduced through images and context clues. Students answer literal and inferential comprehension questions. | 1.L.4a–c – Determine meanings of unknown words using context. 1.R.2 – Ask and answer questions about key details. |
| **Writing & speaking integration** | Students complete sentences, use vocabulary in short oral responses, or retell details from the story. | 1.W.1 – Use drawing, dictating, and writing to express ideas. 1.S.1 – Participate in collaborative conversations and oral responses. |
| **Closure & reflection** | Students connect the story to personal experiences or emotions through drawing or discussion. | 1.S.1 – Express thoughts and feelings clearly. 1.R.2 – Retell key details from a text. |
| **Reinforcement & family connection** | Students play phonics mini-games or repeat chants, then share what they learned with family. | 1.R.3 – Decode regularly spelled words. 1.S.1 – Engage in simple presentations or discussions about familiar topics. |
