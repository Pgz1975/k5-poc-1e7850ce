**AI-Adaptive Interactive Reading Module – Second Grade (Below & On Grade Level)**

**Purpose**

To strengthen foundational reading domains (phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension) through adaptive AI lessons that respond to each learner’s pace and provide immediate, personalized feedback.

**General Lesson Structure**

| Section | Description | PRDE Standards (Grade 2\) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Story narration** | AI reads aloud with visual cues and natural pauses to build rhythm and fluency. | 2.R.1, 2.R.3 |
| **Phonics & decoding** | Students tap, drag, or repeat to identify sounds, blends, and word patterns. | 2.R.FS.11 a–d |
| **Vocabulary & meaning** | Learners connect new words to visuals, context, and definitions. | 2.L.4 a–c |
| **Comprehension** | Students answer literal and inferential questions with immediate feedback. | 2.R.1, 2.R.2, 2.R.3 |
| **Writing & speaking** | Sentence completion, retelling, and opinion prompts with AI assistance. | 2.W.1, 2.S.1 |
| **Socio-emotional reflection** | Learners relate the story’s theme to real-life values and emotions. | 2.S.1 |

**Lesson 1 – Below Grade Level: “The Little Boat in the Bay”**  
**Domains Covered**  
Phonological Awareness · Phonics · Fluency · Vocabulary · Comprehension

**Objective**  
Students will identify story elements, decode words, and answer literal comprehension questions with visual and audio support.

**Standards**  
2.R.1 · 2.R.2 · 2.R.3 · 2.R.FS.11a–d · 2.L.4a–c · 2.W.1 · 2.S.1

**Phase 1 – Narration & Listening**

AI narrates the story with pauses, guiding students to observe illustrations and track print.

**Phase 2 – Literal Comprehension**  
Students answer multiple-choice questions (Who, What, Where, How).

* **Example:** “Who was in the story?”   
* **Emotional Connection:** “How did Mateo feel?” 

AI Feedback: “Great job\! Mateo learned it’s okay to let go and learn something new.”

**Phase 3 – Vocabulary & Morphology**  
Words: dock · breeze · float · drift · smile.  
Activities: tap-to-hear, match to picture, add endings (-ing, \-ed).  
“You matched the words perfectly\! Each one tells part of Mateo’s adventure.”

**Phase 4 – Writing & Creative Integration**  
Students drag words to complete sentences:  
“Mateo made a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_.”   
Drawing prompt: “My Boat’s Next Adventure.”

**Phase 5 – Closure & Reflection**

Students select emojis to describe how they felt reading the story.  
“Sometimes letting go helps us discover new things.”

**Lesson 2 – On Grade Level: “The Clever Parrot”**  
**Domains Covered**  
Phonics · Vocabulary · Fluency · Inferential Comprehension · Speaking

**Objective**

Students will infer character traits and meanings of new vocabulary while reading aloud with AI guidance.

**Standards**  
2.R.1 · 2.R.3 · 2.L.4a–c · 2.W.1 · 2.S.1

**Phase 1 – Story Narration**  
AI reads “The Clever Parrot,” pausing for comprehension.

“Listen carefully and follow along. You can read with me\!”

**Phase 2 – Vocabulary**  
Words: clever · spell · wing · flap · parrot.  
Students tap or drag to match each word to its meaning or picture.  
“Paco says you’re spelling like a pro\!”

**Phase 3 – Inferential Comprehension**  
Questions like:

* Why did Sofia laugh?   
* What did the teacher think of Paco? 

AI Feedback: “You’re becoming a clever reader too\!”

**Phase 4 – Writing & Speaking**  
Students complete sentences and express opinions orally:  
“Sofia felt \_\_\_\_\_\_\_.”   
“Would you like a pet that helps you study?” 

**Phase 5 – Creative Closure**  
Poem: *“Paco, the Clever Parrot.”*  
Students repeat lines, draw, and say what Paco did.  
*“What did you learn?”*   
*AI Feedback:* “Excellent\! You’re a clever reader just like Paco\!”

**Socio-Emotional & Cultural Integration**

Both lessons encourage empathy, resilience, and family values.

* “The Little Boat in the Bay” teaches acceptance and emotional regulation.  
* “The Clever Parrot” promotes teamwork, persistence, and pride in learning.
