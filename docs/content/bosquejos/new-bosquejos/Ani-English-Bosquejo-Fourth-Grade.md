**Lesson 1 – Below Grade Level: “The Lemonade Lab”**   
**Revise Format \- Below Grade Level**

**Objective**  
Students develop decoding, sequencing, and vocabulary comprehension using a science-themed narrative that merges reading with inquiry and teamwork.

**Standards** 4.R.1–4.R.3 · 4.L.1 · 4.L.4 · 4.W.2 · 4.W.5 · S.4.1–S.4.4

**Phase 1 – Listening Warm-Up**

* Rhyme match: “Which word rhymes with mix?”   
* Beginning sound: “Which word starts like measure?”   
  AI Feedback: “Nice work\! You’re tuning your ear to the sounds of science words.”

**Phase 2 – Phonics & Word Work**

* Syllable count: experiment   
* Vowel sound:   
* Drag & Drop: Order ingredients 

AI Feedback: “Great sequencing\! You mixed words and ideas in order.”

**Phase 3 – Vocabulary in Context**

* Words: experiment, observe, measure, recipe, ingredient.  
  Activities: synonym/antonym match, context-fill, and category sort.  
  AI Feedback: “You used your science vocabulary just like a real experimenter\!”

**Phase 4 – Fluency & Expression**  
Students match tone and punctuation:

* “It was too sour\!”   
* “We discovered the perfect formula\!” 

AI Feedback: “Your reading voice shows emotion — that’s great fluency\!”

**Phase 5 – Comprehension**

* Setting: At a lemonade stand   
* Problem: Too sour   
* Inference: They enjoy learning 

AI Feedback: “Science and teamwork helped them succeed\!”

**Phase 6 – Writing & Reflection**

* Topic sentence: Learning can be fun   
* Lesson: Science is about testing again   
* Opinion vs. Fact sorting, sequencing, and closing reflection.  
  AI Feedback: “You discovered that learning is sweeter when shared\!”

**Lesson 2 – On Grade Level: “The Mystery at Maple Creek”**   
**Revised Format \- On Grade Level…**

**Objective**  
Students apply inferential reasoning, cause/effect analysis, and evidence-based thinking through an environmental science narrative.

**Standards** 4.R.1–4.R.3 · 4.L.4 · 4.RF.4 · 4.W.2 · 4.W.5

**Phase 1 – Listening Warm-Up**

* Rhyme:   
* Sound match:   
  AI Feedback: “You found the right rhythm — now let’s solve the mystery\!”

**Phase 2 – Phonics & Word Work**

* Long vowel:   
* Soft ‘g’:   
* Syllables:   
  AI Feedback: “Excellent\! You decoded science words like a pro.”

**Phase 3 – Vocabulary in Context**

* Words: ecosystem, engineering, purpose, gurgle, creek, observation.  
* Activities: synonym/antonym match, definition fill-in, and image pairing.  
  AI Feedback: “Your word choices show you understand how nature works.”

**Phase 4 – Fluency & Expression**  
Students identify tone and phrasing:

* “We solved the mystery\!”   
* “They observed quietly.”   
  AI Feedback: “You read with the same curiosity as the explorers.”

**Phase 5 – Comprehension**

* Cause: They heard a sound → Effect: They found the beaver   
* Main idea: Observation helps solve mysteries   
* Inference: Nature’s sounds have purpose   
  💬 AI Feedback: “You connected clues like a scientist and a reader\!”

**Phase 6 – Writing & Reflection**

* Topic sentence: Sounds in nature can teach us important things   
* Summary: Students observed, discovered, and learned about beavers   
* Closing: Now I want to learn more about ecosystems   
  AI Feedback: “Your reflection shows curiosity — the heart of science\!”
